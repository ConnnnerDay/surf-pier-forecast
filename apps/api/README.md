# apps/api

The canonical FastAPI service named by
[`docs/CANONICAL_ROADMAP.md`](../../docs/CANONICAL_ROADMAP.md)'s technical
contract: versioned `/v1` endpoints, deployed on an always-on Render
service, signed and called only from `apps/web`'s backend-for-frontend —
never directly from a browser.

## Status: skeleton

This app currently proves the canonical path boots and has a real CI
job — nothing more. It does not yet have the `/v1` routes, the ported
forecast domain logic, or a Postgres connection. Those land in the Phase 2
sprints listed in the roadmap's sprint ledger (11 onward), each behind its
own characterization tests, porting from the reconciliation audit
([`docs/R1_RECONCILIATION_AUDIT.md`](../../docs/R1_RECONCILIATION_AUDIT.md))
rather than copying `v2/backend` or the legacy Flask app verbatim.

## Local dev

```bash
cd apps/api
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # includes runtime deps + ruff/mypy/pytest/httpx
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Smoke test:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/live
curl http://localhost:8000/health/ready
# both return {"status": "ok"}
```

## Checks

Run these from `apps/api` with the dev venv active — they mirror
`.github/workflows/apps-ci.yml`:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy .
pytest -q
```
